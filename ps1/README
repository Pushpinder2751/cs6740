This is a simple client-server broadcast chat application.

Server Listens for new clients. Clients join by sending a GREETINGS message

Server then broadcast all the messages from each client. It uses UDP sockets.

In client, I have used socket.socket to look for change in input/STDIN instead
of multiple threads.
